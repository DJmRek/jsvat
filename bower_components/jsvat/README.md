Check the validity of the format of an EU VAT number specified. 

What is it?
--------

jsvat is a small library to check validity of European (and few non-eu) VAT number. ([learn][1] more about VAT)


How does jsvat check the validity?
---------

There is 2-step check:

1. Compare with list of Regexps;

  For exapmle regexp for austria is `/^(AT)U(\d{8})$/`.
 
 Looks like `ATU99999999` is valid (it's successfied the regexp), but actually it's should be invalid.

2. Some magic mathematical counting;

 Here we make some mathematical calculation (different for each country).
 After that we may be sure that `ATU99999999`and for example `ATV66889218` isn't valid, but `ATU12011204` is valid.

At the moment the code was in public access without any license information.

I'm totally rewrite all the code.
